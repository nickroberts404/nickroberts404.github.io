##### What I Did This Past Week

This past week we wrapped up the final iteration of our SWE project. It didn't take too much, but I wasn't available to contribute the Wednesday and Thursday because of an out-of-state climbing competition so my perception may be skewed. In class we discussed more design patterns, which I think is an awesome topic for the class! I've heard people refer to the "singleton" pattern before, but never fully understood what it meant until this week. 

##### What's In My Way

With the end of the semester approaching, it appears as if all of my group projects will have to be wrapped up at the same time. This really shouldn't be too "in the way", because they are all nearly complete; I'm only worried that my procrastination will rear its head before the weekend.

##### What I'll Do Next Week

Next week I'll help prepare our group presentation. We need to complete our evaluations as well as implement another team's API. I forgot that the presentation order will determined by decreasing group numbers, so we will be presenting on Friday rather than the Monday I had calculated. At least my weekend will be worry free! Just kidding, I have 4 tests spanning a three day period that week.

##### Tip O' The Week
* **[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)**: Now that you're all masters of Python, you will probably begin looking for project ideas and ways to build awesome apps! BeautifulSoup is a scraping library for Python, allowing you to drag data out of HTML. Ideally there would be an open API for all the data you could wish for, but realistically that is not the case. Web scraping can be used to retrieve data buried in HTML, such as weather information, gas prices, or even IMDB data. Go nuts! But of course be mindful of the scraped site's wishes and intentions; there may be a reason they don't provide an API. 

*Example:* I created a small script using BeautifulSoup that scrapes a climbing website [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/) and makes a POST request to an API I built, adding the data to a database for later consumption. The following GIF shows it scraping data for Joshua Tree. It performs a depth-first search on the root area, spidering through until it hits a list of routes, which act as leaves.
