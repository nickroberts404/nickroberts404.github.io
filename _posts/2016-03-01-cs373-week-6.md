##### What I Did This Past Week
This past week in Software Engineering we learned about interesting ways to handle function arguments and had a behind the scenes look into how ranges work. On Wednesday, Conrad Stoll, of Mutial Mobile, came to the class and gave an excellent talk about open source software. He showed the many ways open source can be used to create great software, and some examples of successful projects. I have a lot of projects on [Github](https://github.com/nickroberts404), but none of them were really designed to be collaborative. It seems like creating collaborative projects on Github would be a great way to become a better developer; Not only would you benefit from multiple eyes, but you would be forced to think about your code's readability and [smelliness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell).

##### What's In My Way
This coming Thursday we'll have our first test. This will be the first test I've ever taken on Canvas in a classroom, so I'm excited to see what the process is like. I hope it makes the tests easier/quicker to grade.

##### What I'll Do Next Week
Study Study Study! I have a few assignments due early in the week, but afterwards I'll be free to focus on reviewing the list of topics we were given. After studying I'll take the test, and then probably go get a mini Frosty from Wendy's. 

##### Tip O' The Week
**[Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)** is a site filled with quality web development tutorials. Some content is paid, but it has plenty of free tutorials spanning from React to D3 to Elm. While not as flashy as sites like Treehouse and CodeSchool, Egghead.io makes up for it by having fantastic developers as teachers. My favorite is the series on [Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux), taught by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)(the creator of Redux). A course everyone in this class would find very valuable is [How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library). I initially just watched the part on using Mocha and Chai for unit testing, but I was drawn in and completed the whole course!
