title: CS373&#58; Week 10
---

##### What I Did This Past Week
This past week my team and I spend a lot of time working on our CS373 project. Because of the way our time was split by Spring Break, it felt like we started a bit late, but I'm happy with what we turned in. We spent some time discussing relational algebra in class, most of which I've already covered in my Data Management class. It's an important concept to understand, a language-agnostic understanding of querys. In many ways, this week was my hardest so far. Spending more than a week away from my laptop was nice, but we became strangers and it was hard to begin working on school again.

##### What's In My Way
I plan on meeting with my team once or twice this week to work on our API, but we built the frontend in such a way that it's already dynamic, hopefully cutting down on the amount of time this stage will require. Maybe outside of this post's scope, but our next CS331 test will be soon and I need to begin studying for that now if I want to do well.

##### What I'll Do Next Week
This upcoming week will be a bit more relaxed than the last. I still have algorithm homework due but I think I'll have enough time to give it space and work on it slowly. My team and I will continue working on our web app, implementing our API in our frontend and collecting more data. 

##### Tip O' The Week
* **[D3](https://d3js.org/)** If you've been invlolved in the JavaScript world for any amount of time, odds are you've heard about D3. D3 is a data visualization library for JavaScript, capable of creating stunning visualizations for just about any data set. While it may take initiative to learn, it can provide some good spice for your CS373 site! *(A large list of tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials))*
