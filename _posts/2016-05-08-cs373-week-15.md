##### What I Did This Past Week

I spent the past week studying for all of the tests I had. Most of them acted as my farewell to the courses, which was kind of bittersweet. I really enjoyed my time at UT, and while this semester has been the most difficult of my entire school career, I'm happy it turned out the way it did... now I won't miss it so much! I learned a lot this year, especially in SWE. 

##### What's In My Way

The rest of my life. It's a dream of mine to live in a van and freelance, and I know that getting started with freelancing won't be easy. It's a tradition in the climbing community to live in a van and travel around to different climbing locations in the country, pairing perfectly with my love for web development. It would be "safer" for me to get a full time job now and save up some money, but I would be fool to give up this obvious opportunity to follow my dream. 

##### What I'll Do Next Week

I don't really have much school work to do now, so I'll finally have time to continue working on my own web projects! I'll try and get in the sun a bit and finish planning a climbing trip set for May 22nd - June 3rd.
