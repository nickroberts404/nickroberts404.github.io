##### What I Did This Past Week
This past week in Software Engineering we went over the requirements for our Collatz Project again. Then 
we delved into how unit tests work and why we should use them on our software projects. The tool `coverage` seems
really interesting to me, for testing as well as finding unused functions in legacy code. I need to look into 
code coverage tools for JavaScript. 
##### What's In My Way
The deadline for Project 1 is approaching, so I'll need to hop on that. I also want to wrap up or polish a few personal projects 
that I'll be able to put on my portfolio. We can get extra credit for creating a portfolio using [Seelio](https://seelio.com/), 
but I think I'd like to build my own.
##### What I'll Do Next Week
Next week I'll complete Project 1, as it's due Thursday. We'll hopefully be introduced to Project 2, I'm excited to see what it is. From everything we've read, it seems like working with a partner is an excellent practice in the software field. Hopefully Project 2 will allow us to excersise this practice, because I feel like it may take some getting used to.

##### Tip O' The Week
My Tip O' The Week is actually three references to fantastic learning material I've found. 

* **For you JavaScript Developers:** Awesome Youtube tutorials on awesome things like using Browserify to write modular front-end code or Node to create command line tools, [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqYfSWEcyBGorRGvPsHkgg).
* **For all you Web Designers:** A great video about using CSS3's new layout tool, flexbox, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7EIAgfkhmg).
* **For those that aren't using Bash aliases:** A great written tutorial from Digital Ocean on how to alter your `.bashprofile` to create permanent aliases, which have helped me increase my productivty, [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-useful-bash-aliases-and-functions).
