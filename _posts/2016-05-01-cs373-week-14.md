##### What I Did This Past Week

This past week my group and I wrapped up and presented our project! It felt fantastic to get that out of the way, but I'll miss being able to work on web development while not even procrastinating. I became interested in web development last November, and once I realized that I had a passion for it, my grades plumetted. It's difficult to love programming; it's always begging my attention when I try to work on normal school work.

##### What's In My Way

This upcoming week is going to be busy, I have 4 major tests in a 3 day period. I foresee a few sleepless nights. 

##### What I'll Do Next Week

Next week I'll be studying for all of my tests, including SWE! I really liked our last test, it tested real understanding of the concepts and underlying structures of Python instead of just memorization. I'll also be watching the rest of the presentations, I'm excited to see what they've come up with!

##### Tip O' The Week
* **[SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com)**: The web moves extremely fast. The technologies and techniques we are using today will be considered absolete 5 years from now. However, it's still important to stay up to date and at least keep an eye on modern best practices/tech stacks. SurviveJS is an ebook/tutorial that leads you through the creation of Kanban app using modern tools such as React, Babel, and Webpack.
