##### What I Did This Past Week
This past week in Software Engineering we dove deeper into the intricacies of Python. We learned that `assert` statements are not appropriate in production code, and that Python's exceptions handle errors in a more robust way. Our reading included a paper on pair programming *(A practice we'll get to exercise in our upcoming assignment)* and Agile development, satisfying my hopes of this class being directly applicable to the real world. I finished the Collatz assignment on Thursday, a while before our 10pm deadline, but the unforgiving turn-in method still had me worried all day.
##### What's In My Way
This semester is proving to be challenging, and this next week is going to be a busy one. We'll begin our second assignment, a fun machine learning problem based on the [Netflix Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize). Despite having a demanding workload, Software Engineering has become my vacation class. This isn't because it's easy *(it's not)*, but because we're learning material that I would be learning in my free time even without school.
##### What I'll Do Next Week
This upcoming week I'll begin working on the Netflix project and probably have more Python fun. I would also like to begin reading a few books I have; it seems like there's not enough time in the day, but I'm sure that even reading just 10 pages a day would help.

##### Tip O' The Week
Today I went to the Austin public library and discovered a treasure trove of tech books! I was happy to learn they keep their tech books up to date *(The PCL would do well to follow their example)*. If you're interested in reading about our craft and expanding your skills *(or reading at all)*, I would recommend heading down there and checking it out.  
The books I got: 

* **Above The Fold**: *Understanding the Principles Of Successful Web Site Design*

* **Evil By Design**: *Interaction Design to Lead Us Into Temptation*

As I sit here in Central Market and leaf through their first couple pages, I can confidently recommend them to anyone that is interested in web and/or interaction design. After all, why engineer software if nobody would want to use it.
