##### What I Did This Past Week
This past week in Software Engineering we were introduced to our second assignment: Netflix. It seems like an interesting exercise in light machine learning, but I think the main take away will be what we learn from working in a team. On Wednesday we were visited by Ben Porter, a UT Alum that works at Austin's [Main Street Hub](www.mainstreethub.com), a full-service marketing automation company. He gave us insights into what it's like to work in the industry and what types of tools they use. 

##### What's In My Way
The deadline for our second project is approaching, and I still don't have a good idea of how much time it'll consume. Depending on how complicated our algorithm is supposed to be, it may take a while. I also have work in my other 5 classes that I need to work on if I want to graduate this semester!

##### What I'll Do Next Week
This upcoming week I'll continue working on the Netflix project with my partner. We've gotten our project bootstrapped much faster than I expected and are already working on the intereting bit of code. We'll probably delve deeper into the Python language; looking at the schedule tells me I'll finally know what lambda's are!

##### Tip O' The Week
This week I have another set of recommendations! *(This section is a fantastic opportunity to unload your "Development" bookmarks folder)*

* **[Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)** is a realistic data generator that greatly speeds up testing apps. You tell it what type of data you want, and it spins up a mock in json, csv, and other formats.

* **[Shields.io](http://shields.io/)** is a site that provides a bunch of little status images for your project. Want to see if your Travis build is passing or what version your NPM module is on? Just grab the desired image URL, replace the default info with your own, and put it anywhere you want! This is the image for our current Netflix build: [![travis CI build status](https://api.travis-ci.com/nickroberts404/cs373-netflix.svg?token=UVAtiNVYRqWKqqzv7VqM&branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/nickroberts404/cs373-netflix)

* **[Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/)** is geospatial analysis library for JavaScript, created by the awsome team behind [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You can definitely come up with cool stuff for this, like maybe placing a 5 mile buffer around your next roadtrip's path and see if any high-rating coffeshops intersect with the buffer. Boom, coffee themed roadtrip!
