### First Week of Classes
This week was the first week of my last semester at UT. 
Although it seems challenging, Software Engineering is the course I most look forward to this year. 
Before our first day, I was worried that it would be another Java based class *(not my cup of Java)* with lessons borrowed from the 90's. Fortunately, my worries are far from reality. Instead, we'll learn how to use modern tools, services, and techniques to build solid software.
##### What I Did This Past Week
This past week in Software Engineering we discussed how the semester would go and the types of things we would learn. 
We were assigned our first assignment, Collatz, which will introduce us to many of the tools we'll be using throughout the course.
This blog was also born this week.
##### What's In My Way
What's on my mind right now is completing our Collatz assignment, and creating a new theme for my blog. 
##### What I'll Do Next Week
Next week I'll continue to work on our Collatz project, and hopefully wrap up some personal projects as well.

I'm really excited to learn how to write tests properly. TDD (Test Driven Development) is something I hear a lot about but have never taken the time to practice. I'm also happy that keeping a blog is an extra credit opportunity, as I've been meaning to start one to begin to practice writing.

##### Tip O' The Week
My tip of the week is a tiny data converter called [Mr.Data Converter](https://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/)

It takes CSV data as input and quickly outputs the data in a few different formats, such as

* JSON
* An HTML `<table>`
* XML
* A Python dictionary
* and more...

Overall, I feel like this class could be the single most important class of my college career, and just at the right time too!
